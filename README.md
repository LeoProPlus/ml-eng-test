# Machine Learning Engineer Test: Computer Vision and Object Detection

## Objective
This test aims to assess your skills in computer vision and object detection, with a specific focus on detecting room walls and identifying rooms in architectural blueprints or pre-construction plans.

This test evaluates your practical skills in applying advanced computer vision techniques to a specialized domain and your ability to integrate machine learning models into a simple API server for real-world applications.

Choose one of the visual tasks, one of the text extraction tasks, and the API Server task. We encourage you to submit your tests even if you canâ€™t complete all tasks.

Good luck!

## Task solutions
In this repository we present solutions for two tasks: walls detection and table extraction.

### Walls detection
For detecting walls we used a Mask R-CNN [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870.pdf] trained on CubiCasa5k dataset [https://github.com/CubiCasa/CubiCasa5k]. Details about training including the training log can be found in `src\ml\walls_detection\training.ipynb` notebook. Details about experimental evaluation (quality & quantity analysis) can be found in `src\ml\walls_detection\evaluation.ipynb` notebook.

### Table extraction

For table extraction we used pretrained table transformers [https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/table-transformer] followed by EasyOcr [https://pypi.org/project/easyocr/]. The second considered OCR was TrOCR [https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/trocr]. TrOCR was performing poorly compared to Easy OCR and was removed. The full table extraction pipeline with step-by-step visualization can be found in `src\ml\table_extraction\walkthrough_table_extraction.ipynb` notebook.

## Cloning repository
This repository uses 1 submodule:
- https://github.com/LeoProPlus/CubiCasa5k
    - Fork of the official CubiCasa5k dataset repo. It is used for training. We utilize a few functions in order to read CubiCasa5k dataset.

 The best way to clone everything at once is to run the following command:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LeoProPlus/ml-eng-test
```

## Runing smoke tests
In order to run smoke tests and to be sure that everything will work as expected, execute the following command from the project root directory

```
docker compose -f src/docker-compose.test.yml up --build
```

The test container should exit with status code `0` E.g.

```
webserver-test  | webserver/tests/test_api_smoke.py .....                                  [100%]
webserver-test  | 
webserver-test  | ------------ generated xml file: /home/jovyan/webserver/report.xml -------------
webserver-test  | ================== 5 passed, 2 warnings in 155.15s (0:02:35) ===================
webserver-test exited with code 0
```

## Installation

To install everything at once run the following command from project root directory:
```
docker compose -f src/docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

This command will start two applications:
1. Webserver for serving API with `Swagger` documentation available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

    ![image](./docs/swagger.png)

2. JupyterLab available at http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab

    ![image](./docs/jupyterlab.png)

## API Testing
For API testing purposes you can use `Swagger` available at [http:/localhost:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/), or you can use cURL. Example cURL commands are presented below.

### Example cURL
```
# walls
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?type=walls' -F 'image=@src/ml/walls_detection/data/examples/F1_original.png'
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?type=walls' -F 'image=@src/ml/walls_detection/data/examples/A-191.pdf_0_scaled.jpg'

# tables
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?type=tables' -F 'image=@src/ml/table_extraction/data/input/table_example.png'
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?type=tables' -F 'image=@src/ml/table_extraction/data/input/image_1.jpg'
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?type=tables' -F 'image=@src/ml/table_extraction/data/input/image_2.png'
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?type=tables' -F 'image=@src/ml/table_extraction/data/input/image_3.png'
```
